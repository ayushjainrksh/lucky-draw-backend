# Lucky draw backend

## Problem statement
Design & implement a service which allows users to get Lucky Draw Raffle tickets and use one lucky draw raffle ticket to participate in a lucky draw game.

### Requirements
- Design an API which allows users to get the raffle tickets. This API can be consumed in a lot of ways like We can call this API after the user has placed an Order.
- Design an API which shows the next Lucky Draw Event timing & the corresponding reward. For example - Lucky Draw can run everyday at 8AM. Reward on say 10th Feb is Phone, 11th Feb is Washing Machine etc.
- Design an API which allows users to participate in the game. Once a user has participated with a raffle ticket, they shouldnâ€™t be able to participate again in the same event.
- Design an API which lists all the winners of all the events in the last one week.
- Compute the winner for the event and announce the winner.
